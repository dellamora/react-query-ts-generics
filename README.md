## Rick and Morty Search

The main goal of this project was to create a simple application that would serve as a practical study for the use of TypeScript's generic types and the implementation of React Query. By using the Rick and Morty API to allow users to search for characters, episodes, and locations, this project provides a hands-on approach to learning these technologies.
